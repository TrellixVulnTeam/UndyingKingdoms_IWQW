A fun game.

#### Development Setup Instructions

I am going to be adding to this through the next few days.

1. Install docker with `sudo apt install docker.io`

From https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver

2. The following linux commands will start Docker and ensure that starts after the reboot:
    > $ sudo systemctl start docker
    
    > $ sudo systemctl enable docker

    All done.

    > $ docker --version
    
    > Docker version 17.03.2-ce, build f5ec1e2
